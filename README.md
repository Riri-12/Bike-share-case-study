# Bike Share case study

### Introduction


This case study is a part of Google Data Analytics Certification Course. I have completed this project by applying the skills I have learned from the course. 


### Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the Company


In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. 
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. 


Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


### Business Task



The data analyst is to conduct an analysis on usage of Cyclistic bikes by member and casual riders and use these insights to apply on marketing strategies to convert casual riders into members.


### Key Stakeholders

•	Lily Moreno- the director of marketing 

•	Cyclistic marketing analytics team

•	Cyclistic executive team


### Data Background

Data was obtained from Motivate International Inc. from [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Due to privacy reasons, the rider’s personal information are not made public. for this project, I downloaded bike share data from Jan22-Dec22. The data was collected by the company which makes the data original and reliable. The data is comprehensive, current, and cited.


### Data Analysis
The data analysis process of cleaning, data tranformation, and visualization was completed in RStudio.


### Conclusion

The Casual riders appeared to ride the bikes for longer time than the Member riders. However, member riders used bikes more consistently as compared to casual riders who rode the bikes more often on weekends and summertime. The bike data patterns and trends indicate that casual riders ride bikes more often for leisure and recreational activities whereas the Member riders ride bikes for commute to work.


### Recommendations

Based on analysis, the following recommendations are provided to apply on the marketing strategies to convert casual riders into member riders.

1.	The data shows that the casual riders ride more on weekends and Summertime so targeted promotions can be implemented by offering special discounts, or incentives to casual riders who sign up for membership.

2.	Promote awareness of membership benefits and potential cost savings to the casual riders so they will be attracted towards getting a membership compared to paying for single rides. 

3.	Increase single ride pays in order to encourage Casual riders to become member riders utilizing membership perks
